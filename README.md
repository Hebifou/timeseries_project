# Time Series Project â€“ Forecasting with ARIMA & Prophet

This project demonstrates an **end-to-end time series forecasting workflow** using **SARIMA** and **Prophet** models.  
The goal is to explore temporal patterns (trend, seasonality, noise) and predict future values on a synthetic daily dataset.

---

## roject Overview
- **Goal:** Build, evaluate, and compare classical (SARIMA) and modern (Prophet) time series models.  
- **Techniques:**  
  - Time series decomposition (trend, seasonality, residuals)  
  - ADF stationarity test  
  - Baseline vs. model performance comparison  
  - Multi-step forecasting and visual validation  
- **Tools:** Python, Pandas, Statsmodels, Prophet, Matplotlib
